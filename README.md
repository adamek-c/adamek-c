# Hi, I'm Adam ^\_~

Hi this is Adam I will tell you a little about myself in a few words.
My adventure with programming began in early 2021 by watching videos on YouTube, and so it began. I decided to enroll in a Kodilla course to increase my skills, after completing the course I am still deepening my knowledge through courses on Udemy or even by reading documentation
